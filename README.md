## Download

- [Latest Release](https://github.com/whaatt/buzzkill/releases/latest)

## Basic Usage

1. Open the app (sound **on** for best results)
2. Watch the flies infest your screen
3. Hold `[Option] + [Z]` to keep your swatter activated
4. Click and drag your mouse away from a target
5. Release only your mouse to swat

## Advanced Usage

Control these features from the application panel (located in your status bar):

- **Auto-Spawn Mode:** Spawn flies on a scheduled interval (from an initial count up to a target
  limit). This is the default behavior when you open the app and you can turn it off as desired
- **Time Trial:** Swat a fixed number of flies as fast as you can. View your PRs in the status bar
  panel
- **Roast Mode:** Connect to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) and have the flies roast you on
  behalf of [@dril](https://x.com/dril). Or bend the flies to your liking by modifying `prompt.txt`
  at [this folder path](container.txt)
- **Custom Key Combo:** Set your own key combo to activate the swatter
- **System Controls:** Control launch at login and auto-update behavior
- **Sound Controls:** Set the app's master volume and control individual sounds
- **macOS Shortcuts:** Control your overlay from the macOS Shortcuts app (**not** a panel setting)

**Tip:** You can always double-tap your current key combo to open the settings panel.
